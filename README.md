# VideoClip_Class
Creates a Simple Videoclip Class Using Classes &amp; Constructors in C++

# Steps:
1. Create the VideoClip class outline.
2. Create member variables for video length and video name.
3. Write a default constructor that initializes the video length and name to a default value.
4. Write a parameterized constructor that sets the video length and name to the passed parameters.
5. Create a data char array and data size member variables and initialize them in both constructors.
6. Create a copy constructor that correctly handles the copying of the data array.
7. Create a copy assignment operator overload that correctly handles the copying of the data array.
8. Write a destructor that deletes the allocated data array.
9. Update the main function to create three different code instances and output their values.
10. Test the copy constructor and copy assignment operators within the main function by initializing a video clip using an existing instance and initializing an instance of a video clip with its constructor and then later assigning it to another existing instance.
